# Movies-ETL
Extract, Load, and Transfer movie databases
The purpose of this analysis was to create data pipelines to clean raw movie data using the extract, transform, and load process (ETL). Once the movie data was cleaned and transformed, they were loaded into a postgreSQL database for further analysis.
