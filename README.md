# Movies-ETL
#### Extract, Load, and Transfer movie databases

The purpose of this analysis was to create data pipelines to clean raw movie data from Wikipedia and Kaggle using the extract, transform, and load process (ETL). Once the data was parsed through and cleaned, they were loaded into a postgreSQL database for further analysis.
